**Lovable project:** https://lovable.dev/projects/db3136f6-f3b2-4dc9-a9a3-7451db74402e

A no-login, accessible typing practice app that helps court staff (and anyone) build foundational digital skills through short, varied passages and clear feedback.

## Storyboard & Justification

**Project Title:** Office Keys (working name: ‚ÄúTypeSpeed Pro‚Äù)  
**Developer:** La Shara Cordero  
**Intended Platform:** Santa Barbara County Superior Court intranet (internal)  
**Project Type:** Foundational digital skills practice

**Purpose:** Provide a no-cost, low-barrier way for staff to practice keyboarding with gamified repetition‚Äîimproving speed and comfort for common digital workflows (email, forms, data entry).

### 1) The need
- **Digital skills are baseline:** ~**92% of U.S. jobs require digital skills** to some extent.  
  Sources: National Skills Coalition (NSC) ‚Äî *Closing the Digital Skill Divide*; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ‚Äî *Baseline for Work: 92% of Jobs Require Digital Skills*.  
  - NSC: <https://nationalskillscoalition.org/resource/publications/closing-the-digital-skill-divide/>  
  - Atlanta Fed: <https://www.atlantafed.org/community-development/publications/partners-update/2023/08/10/baseline-for-work-92-percent-of-jobs-require-digital-skills>
- **Skills gap is real:** Roughly **one-third of U.S. workers lack basic digital skills** (typing, email, basic software). (NSC report above)
- **Public sector challenge:** Many employees learn on the job without structured practice; online tools can be blocked or too complex.

> **Why typing?** Faster, more accurate typing alone can reclaim time on common tasks. If someone types ~2,000 words/day (20 emails √ó 100 words):  
> ‚Ä¢ 40 WPM ‚Üí **50 minutes** of pure typing  
> ‚Ä¢ 60 WPM ‚Üí **33 minutes**  
> **‚âà17 minutes saved/day**, ‚âà85 minutes/week  
> *(Pure keystroke time; excludes reading/thinking.)*  
> Sources: HBR on time spent on email <https://hbr.org/2019/01/how-to-spend-way-less-time-on-email-every-day>, typical email word count <https://emailanalytics.com/ideal-email-length/>, typing time calculator <https://www.typingmaster.com/typing-simulator/>, average adult WPM context (‚âà40 WPM) <https://www.typingpal.com/en/blog/what-is-a-good-typing-speed>.

### 2) Storyboard (user journey)
1. **Home ‚Üí Choose Level:** Short / Medium / Long. (No account needed.)  
2. **New Test:** Loads a varied passage (rotates within level; avoids recent repeats).  
3. **Type:** Live feedback; finish to see **WPM, Accuracy, Errors, Time** and a simple grade.  
4. **Review ‚Üí Improve:**  
   - **History** card saves recent runs (local only) + **CSV export**.  
   - **Adaptive next step** gently suggests the next focus (letters, numbers, punctuation, mixed) **without changing the user‚Äôs chosen level**.  
5. **Accessibility & Help:** Toggle **High contrast**, **Large text**, **Dyslexia-friendly font**; first-run dialog explains how it works and hand position.

### 3) Research foundation (selected)
- **Contextualized practice** (work-like tasks) improves digital learning outcomes. NSC report above.  
- **Digital literacy** links to job quality and equity:  
  - Atlanta Fed: <https://www.atlantafed.org/community-development/publications/partners-update/2023/08/10/baseline-for-work-92-percent-of-jobs-require-digital-skills>  
  - Li, J. et al., *Digital Literacy in the Workforce* (NIH/PMC): <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10611935/>  
- **Time savings** from higher WPM compound across routine communications (HBR/McKinsey + EmailAnalytics + TypingMaster links above).

### 4) Court alignment
| Strategic Goal          | Alignment                                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Workforce development   | Upskilling via no-cost, self-paced practice             |
| Digital transformation  | Reinforces core digital fluency                         |
| Equity & access         | Low-barrier tool for varied starting points             |
| Training & retention    | Non-punitive practice with visible progress             |
