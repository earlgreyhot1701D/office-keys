# Hackathon Storyboard & Project Justification

## Project Title
Office Keys (working name: "TypeSpeed Pro")

**Developer:** La Shara Cordero  
**Intended Platform:** Santa Barbara County Superior Court intranet  
**Project Type:** Foundational digital skills tool

---

## 1) The Need

- **Digital skills are baseline:** ~92% of U.S. jobs require digital skills.  
  Sources: National Skills Coalition; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
- **Skills gap persists:** ~1/3 of U.S. workers lack basic digital skills (typing, email).
- **Public sector challenge:** Many staff learn on the job; available tools are often blocked or too complex.

> **Why typing?**  
> If an employee types ~2,000 words/day:  
> • 40 WPM → ~50 min of typing  
> • 60 WPM → ~33 min  
> ≈ 17 min saved/day → ≈ 85 min/week  
> _Pure typing time only. Sources below._

## 2) Storyboard (User Journey)
1. Select level → Short/Medium/Long  
2. New Test → Loads randomized, rotation-controlled passage  
3. Typing mode → Live metrics  
4. Results → WPM/accuracy/errors/time + grade, history tracking  
5. Adaptive suggestion gently nudges next focus (digits, punctuation)  
6. Accessibility + first-run help available anytime
